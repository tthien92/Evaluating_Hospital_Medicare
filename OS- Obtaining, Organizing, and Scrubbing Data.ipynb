    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ubiquitous problems within the US healthcare system, and one of the biggest problems revolves around costs. While every single hospital in the US has a chargemaster, a list of costs for all billable procedures, accessing this esoteric list as a consumer is nigh impossible, as [Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tct38KwROdw) has demonstrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, market forces that are supposed to drive down prices via competition are ineffective due to the secrecy of these prices. This leads to wild discrepancies between institutions. Human psychology dictates that one's health is vital, which allow many healthcare services and products to have an inelastic demand. Furthermore, this also creates a misconceived notion around utility and price--Ie. consumers believe that paying higher prices for healthcare services actually results in better services.\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation seeks to evaluate whether this ideation is true or if it is simply a misconception. Since chargemasters are secretive, it would be greatly beneficial for the public if there are some other factors that can be used for cost-benefit analysis when it comes to healthcare. Shedding truth on this matter may provide critical information for the public that is necessary for driving down costs for an industry littered with problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a highly accurate model can be established, then many consumers would indeed pay for such information. Of course, this does not need to be in the form of monetary payment. Offering the model as a free-service would lead to high traffic, which would in turn allure merchants to buy advertising pace. "
